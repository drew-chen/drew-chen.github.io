# Personal Website

This website is meant to be a presentation of a few of the things I've done. It's
mostly a more interactive version of my resume with added detail on projects. This website
is a work in progress.

To feature a project, for instance my [sketch](https://github.com/drew-chen/sketch) project, the url can be customized: [drew-chen.github.io/#sketch](https://drew-chen.github.io#sketch). This url scrolls to the featured project then focuses on the project description.

## todo

    - navigation buttons between modals  
* Create contact form
