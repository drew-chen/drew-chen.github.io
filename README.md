# Personal Website

This website is meant to be a presentation of a few of the things I've done. It's
mostly a more interactive version of my resume with added detail on projects. This website
is a work in progress.

To feature a project, for instance, [sketch](https://github.com/drew-chen/sketch), the url can be customized: [drew-chen.github.io/#sketch](https://drew-chen.github.io#sketch). When visiting the custom url, the website automagically scrolls to the featured project then focuses on it. The current url parameters are: `#social-network`, `#sketch`, `#git`, `#this-website`, and `#cipher-machine`.
